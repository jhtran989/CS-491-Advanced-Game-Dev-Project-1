**UPDATE**: Added this retroactively...

High Stakes is a 2D top-down rogue-like with simple procedural generation. The goal of the game is to traverse the square map from one side of the screen to the other (left to right) and make it to the next stage. The player controls a vampire in a forest-like environment and is trying to evade a horde of people (game over if horde touches player). The horde will get slightly faster as the game progresses. There is a stamina bar that the player will have to be mindful of but there will be collectibles that can help refill some stamina (varying items). How long can the vampire last the horde's onslaught?
